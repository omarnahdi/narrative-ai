uv add playwright
playwright install
```

**Alternative Method (using pip)**:

```bash
# Install dependencies using requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install and setup Playwright for web scraping
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

3. Setup environment variables
```bash
# Create .env file from template
copy .example.env .env

# Add your API keys to .env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
BRAVE_API_KEY=your_brave_search_key
```

> **Note**: Playwright is required for web scraping functionality. Make sure to run both the install commands to set up the browser automation

   Write an educational LinkedIn post about 'Context Engineering' for LLMs,
   using insights from this article: https://www.philschmid.de/context-engineering. 
   The post should: Start with a strong hook to grab attention. 
   Simply define Context Engineering and explain its benefits, 
   like improving accuracy and reducing costs compared to fine-tuning. 
   Briefly mention a key technique, such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). 
   Include a simple, practical example to illustrate the concept (e.g., a customer service bot). 
   End with a question to engage the audience and include relevant hashtags like #AI, #ContextEngineering, #LLM, and #RAG.

   Add a little bit of humor to the post as well, use few emojis too
